**Welcome** to Minnesota History. Our course will focus on two themes: home and education. We will ask how Minnesotans created a place they called "home" and how they learned what they needed to survive in this land.

There are no prerequisites for this course, and you do *not* need any specialized knowledge. The class will be taught in English, with occasional cheesy jokes and mild vulgarities in Spanish.

By the end of this class, you should be able to do the following core learning outcomes:

1. Correctly identify major geographic features in Minnesota and explain how geography shapes the history of the state.

2. Write effective historical prose in different genres.

3. Identify and effectively use primary and secondary historical sources.

4. Analyze secondary sources, including websites, videos, and journal articles, for their credibility.

5. Demonstrate how personal history relates to larger historical themes.

6. Develop strategies for advancing your learning skills, such as effective reading, writing, and critically analyzing historical sources.

7. Recognize how to apply skills used in this class outside of the academic setting.

**Required Resources**

- Two chapters from Peg Meier. _Bring Warm Clothes: Letters and Photos from Minnesota's Past_, Minnesota Historical Society Press (Available on reserve in our library.)

- Access to high-speed internet connection with web-accessed computer
-not just a cell phone or tablet. You can use Normandale's computers for this.
